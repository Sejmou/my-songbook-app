A React Native app allowing musicians to manage lyrics for songs

This is still very much a work in progress. However, I managed to implement some basic features already that allow me to use this for myself:

- scrolling through lyrics via MIDI controller (e.g. MIDI footswitch) - useful e.g. for guitarists or other musicians that have no hands free while singing
- syncing of lyrics to SQL database in the 'cloud' ([CockroachDB](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/) Serverless)

This app is not yet deployed anywhere (mainly because I would need to pay 100â‚¬ per year for a developer account that would allow me to publish apps to the App Store lol)

I am working on a project for [controlling Ableton Live via JavaScript in a desktop app](https://github.com/Sejmou/ableton-controls). Beware: It is very hacky and I am still trying to figure out a smarter and more stable way to implement it.
